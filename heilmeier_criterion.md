2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

3. Who cares?

4. If you're successful, what difference will it make?   What impact will success have?  How will it be measured?

5. What are the risks and the payoffs?

6. How much will it cost?

7. How long will it take?

8. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?  How will progress be measured?
