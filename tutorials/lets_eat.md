# Lightly Erratic TaleS from an  Edible Android Tutorial (LET's EAT)

Most tutorials around are monstrous and hard to follow. Hopefully this one would not turn out to be as horrific as the others.

To make things simpler, let's try to build a complete application from start to finish.

###The sample app
An app similar to cowsay fortune. The user gets a button, which they press to hear more from the cow. The cow would be an image unlike ascii art in the original application.

For the initial implemention, we have statements on different lines of a text file somewhere in the app. Let this be static for now.
