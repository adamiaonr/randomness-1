Docker with Ansible

# This is a very fresh guide. Please forgive any errors and misconceptions.

* What is Docker?
- A container manager
- We would be launching applications on the swarmbox on top of Docker.
- Project website:
https://www.docker.com/

This tutorial would show how docker can work with ansible:

* What you need?
- Host machine and Target machine with the same version of docker API (important)
- A docker image (we can create images too, but I'm not too familiar with that). We'll use some simple version of ubuntu for this. There are many options

Use the module documentation from:
http://docs.ansible.com/docker_module.html

-Step 1: install docker on target
use the apt-modules to grab docker.io, python-pip and the pip module for docker-py. Remember to match the API version or change the docker-py version accordingly

-Step 2: Run a container
docker: image=img_name name=continer_name command="starting command" state=present

You can start multiple containers in various ways described in the documentation link.

-Step 3: Stop a container
docker: image=img_name name=continer_name command="starting command" state=killed

* Building images (I'm not really familiar with this):

* Other useful guides:
By a guy at HP (who did the Ansible and Docker video on the site). Old code, so a lotof things have changed, but very detailed:
